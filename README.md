# WiresharkSniffing-WLANChannelDistribution
A mini project for the course ET4394 Wireless Networking offered at TU Delft. The goal of the project is to provide data on the wireless channel distribution, channel sizes and Phy types i.e. to observe and record which channels are being used mostly and by whom at different locations such as @Campus, @Dorm or @Street etc.
