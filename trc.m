% Dynamic rate control algorithm for IEEE 802.11 WLAN which is built upon
% the rate control algorithm provided by Matlab in their WLAN toolbox
% TransmitRateControlExample.m

%% Introduction
% The IEEE(R) 802.11(TM) standard supports dynamic rate control by
% adjusting the MCS value of each transmitted packet based on the
% underlying radio propagation channel. Maximizing link throughput, in a
% propagation channel that is time varying due to multipath fading or
% movement of the surrounding objects, requires dynamic variation of MCS.
% The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define any standardized rate control
% algorithm (RCA) for dynamically varying the modulation rate. The
% implementation of RCA is left open to the WLAN device manufacturers. This
% example uses a closed-loop rate control scheme. A recommended MCS for
% transmitting a packet is calculated at the receiver and is available at
% the transmitter without any feedback latency. In a real system this
% information would be conveyed through a control frame exchange. The MCS
% is adjusted for each subsequent packet in response to an evolving channel
% condition with noise power varying over time.
%
% In this example, an IEEE 802.11ac(TM) [ <#10 1> ] waveform consisting of
% a single VHT format packet is generated using
% <matlab:doc('wlanWaveformGenerator') wlanWaveformGenerator>. The waveform
% is passed through a TGac channel and noise is added. The packet is
% synchronized and decoded to recover the PSDU. The SNR is estimated and
% compared against thresholds to determine which MCS is suitable for
% transmission of the next packet. This figure shows the processing for
% each packet.

%% Waveform Configuration
% An IEEE 802.11ac VHT transmission is simulated in this example. The VHT
% waveform properties are specified in a <matlab:doc('wlanVHTConfig')
% wlanVHTConfig> configuration object. In this example the object is
% initially configured for a 40 MHz channel bandwidth, single transmit
% antenna and QPSK rate-1/2 (MCS 1). The MCS for the subsequent packets
% is changed by the algorithm throughout the simulation.
cfgVHT = wlanVHTConfig;
cfgVHT.ChannelBandwidth = 'CBW40'; % 40 MHz channel bandwidth
cfgVHT.MCS = 1;                    % QPSK rate-1/2
cfgVHT.APEPLength = 4096;          % APEP length in bytes

% Set random stream for repeatability of results
s = rng(21);

MCS = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
% Threshold vectors to be choosen depending on the Channel bandwidth. NOTE-
% 20MHz CBW not supported in this Algorithm
switch cfgVHT.ChannelBandwidth
    case 'CBW40'
        LTs=[5,8,12,14,18,21,23,28,32,36];
        HTs=[7,11,13,17,20,22,27,31,33,38];

        warning('Channel Width not supported in this Algorithm')
end

% Mapping MCS vector to the Threshold vectors
LTMap = containers.Map(MCS,LTs);
HTMap= containers.Map(MCS,HTs);

%% Channel Configuration
% In this example a TGac N-LOS channel model is used with delay profile
% Model-D. For Model-D when the distance between the transmitter and
% receiver is greater than or equal to 10 meters, the model is NLOS. This
% is described further in <matlab:doc('wlanTGacChannel') wlanTGacChannel>.

tgacChannel = wlanTGacChannel;
tgacChannel.DelayProfile = 'Model-D';
tgacChannel.ChannelBandwidth = cfgVHT.ChannelBandwidth;
tgacChannel.NumTransmitAntennas = 1;
tgacChannel.NumReceiveAntennas = 1;
tgacChannel.TransmitReceiveDistance = 20; % Distance in meters for NLOS
tgacChannel.RandomStream = 'mt19937ar with seed';
tgacChannel.Seed = 10;

% Set the sampling rate for the channel
sr = wlanSampleRate(cfgVHT);
tgacChannel.SampleRate = sr;

%% Rate Control Algorithm Parameters
% Typically RCAs use channel quality or link performance metrics, such as
% SNR or packet error rate, for rate selection. The RCA presented in this
% example estimates the SNR of a received packet. On reception, the
% estimated SNR is compared against a predefined threshold. If the SNR
% exceeds the predefined threshold then a new MCS is selected for
% transmitting the next packet. The |rcaAttack| and |rcaRelease| controls
% smooth rate changes to avoid changing rates prematurely. The SNR must
% exceed the |threshold| + |rcaAttack| value to increase the MCS and must
% be under the |threshold| - |rcaRelease| value to decrease the MCS. In
% this simulation |rcaAttack| and |rcaRelease| are set to conservatively
% increase the MCS and aggressively reduce it. For the |threshold| values
% selected for the scenario simulated in this example, a small number of
% packet errors are expected. These settings may not be suitable for other
% scenarios.

snrInd = cfgVHT.MCS; % Store the start MCS value

%% Simulation Parameters
% In this simulation |numPackets| packets are transmitted through a TGac
% channel, separated by a fixed idle time. The channel state is maintained
% throughout the simulation, therefore the channel evolves slowly over
% time. This evolution slowly changes the resulting SNR measured at the
% receiver. Since the TGac channel changes very slowly over time, here an
% SNR variation at the receiver visible over a short simulation can be
% forced using the |walkSNR| parameter to modify the noise power:
%
% # Setting |walkSNR| to true generates a varying SNR by randomly setting
% the noise power per packet during transmission. The SNR walks between
% 14-33 dB (using the |amplitude| and |meanSNR| variables).
% # Setting |walkSNR| to false fixes the noise power applied to the
% received waveform, so that channel variations are the main source of SNR
% changes at the receiver.

numPackets = 100; % Number of packets transmitted during the simulation
walkSNR = true;

% Select SNR for the simulation
if walkSNR
    meanSNR = 22;   % Mean SNR
    amplitude = 14; % Variation in SNR around the average mean SNR value
    % Generate varying SNR values for each transmitted packet
    baseSNR = sin(linspace(1,10,numPackets))*amplitude+meanSNR;
    snrWalk = baseSNR(1); % Set the initial SNR value
    % The maxJump controls the maximum SNR difference between one
    % packet and the next
    maxJump = 0.5;
else
    % Fixed mean SNR value for each transmitted packet. All the variability
    % in SNR comes from a time varying radio channel
    snrWalk = 22; %#ok<UNRCH>

end

% Define simulation variables
snrMeasured = zeros(1,numPackets);
MCS = zeros(1,numPackets);
ber = zeros(1,numPackets);
packetLength = zeros(1,numPackets);
%% Processing Chain
% The following processing steps occur for each packet:
%
% # A PSDU is created and encoded to create a single packet waveform.
% # A fixed idle time is added between successive packets.
% # The waveform is passed through an evolving TGac channel.
% # AWGN is added to the transmitted waveform to create the desired average
% SNR per subcarrier.
% # This local function |processPacket| passes the transmitted waveform
% through the TGac channel, performs receiver processing, and SNR
% estimation.
% # The L-LTF is extracted from the synchronized received waveform. The
% L-LTF is OFDM demodulated and noise estimation is performed.
% # The VHT-LTF is extracted from the received waveform. The
% VHT-LTF is OFDM demodulated and channel estimation is performed.
% # The SNR is estimated using the VHT-LTF field and the noise estimates
% are computed using L-LTF.
% # The estimated SNR is compared against the threshold, the comparison is
% used to adjust the MCS for the next packet.
% # The VHT Data field is extracted from the synchronized received
% waveform. The PSDU is recovered using the extracted field.

%%
% For simplicity, this example assumes:
%
% # Fixed bandwidth and antenna configuration for each transmitted packet.
% # There is no explicit feedback packet to inform the transmitter about
% the suggested MCS setting for the next packet. The example assumes that
% this information is known to the transmitter before transmitting the
% subsequent packet.
% # Fixed idle time of 0.5 milliseconds between packets.

%% Display and Plot Simulation Results
% This example plots the variation of MCS, SNR, BER, and data throughput
% over the duration of the simulation.
%
% # The MCS used to transmit each packet is plotted. When compared to the
% estimated SNR, you can see the MCS selection is dependent on the
% estimated SNR.
% # The bit error rate per packet depends on the channel conditions, SNR,
% and MCS used for transmission.
% # The throughput is maximized by varying the MCS according to the channel
% conditions. The throughput is calculated using a sliding window of three
% packets. For each point plotted, the throughput is the number of data
% bits, successfully recovered over the duration of three packets. The
% length of the sliding window can be increased to further smooth the
% throughput. You can see drops in the throughput either when the MCS
% decreases or when a packet error occurs.

%% Conclusion and Further Exploration
% This example uses a closed-loop rate control scheme where knowledge of
% the MCS used for subsequent packet transmission is assumed to be
% available to the transmitter.
%
% In this example the variation in MCS over time due to the received SNR is
% controlled by the |threshold|, |rcaAttack| and |rcaRelease| parameters.
% The |rcaAttack| and |rcaRelease| are used as controls to smooth the rate
% changes, this is to avoid changing rates prematurely. Try changing the
% |rcaRelease| control to two. In this case, the decrease in MCS is slower
% to react when channel conditions are not good, resulting in higher BER.
%
% Try setting the |displayConstellation| to true in order to plot the
% equalized symbols per received packet, you can see the modulation scheme
% changing over time. Also try setting |walkSNR| to false in order to
% visualize the MCS change per packet. Here the variability in SNR is only
% caused by the radio channel, rather than the combination of channel and
% random walk.
%
% Further exploration includes using an alternate RCA scheme, more
% realistic MCS variation including changing number of space time streams,
% packet size and enabling STBC for subsequent transmitted packets.
